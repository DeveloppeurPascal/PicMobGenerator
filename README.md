# Pic Mob Generator

[Cette page en fran√ßais.](LISEZMOI.md)

[Pic Mob Generator](https://picmobgenerator.olfsoftware.fr) is an icon generator for softwares and mobile apps developers. It uses a simple layer system to design your icons and export them in ICNS, ICO, PNG or JPEG file format for iOS, Android, Linux, macOS and Windows.

If you want to know more about this program and some explanation of its source code, look at [Developpeur Pascal's blog](https://developpeur-pascal.fr/pic-mob-generator.html) and contact the author if you have questions.

Most of the coding time has been done [live on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/patrickpremartin). The replays are available at [Serial Streameur](https://serialstreameur.fr/pic-mob-generator.html).

This code repository contains a project developed in Object Pascal language under Delphi. You don't know what Delphi is and where to download it ? You'll learn more [on this web site](https://delphi-resources.developpeur-pascal.fr/).

## Source code installation

To download this code repository, we recommend using "git", but you can also download a ZIP file directly from [its GitHub repository](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/PicMobGenerator).

This project uses dependencies in the form of sub-modules. They will be absent from the ZIP file. You'll have to download them by hand.

* [DeveloppeurPascal/librairies](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/librairies) must be installed in subfolder "lib-externes\librairies"
* [DeveloppeurPascal/AboutDialog-Delphi-Component](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/AboutDialog-Delphi-Component) must be installed in subfolder "lib-externes\AboutDialog-Delphi-Component"

You also need the [RiverSoftAVG SVG Component Library](https://www.riversoftavg.com/svg.htm) to compile the program. It's used for SVG layers.

## Compatibility

As an [Embarcadero MVP](https://www.embarcadero.com/resources/partners/mvp-directory), I benefit from the latest versions of [Delphi](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi) and [C++ Builder](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/cbuilder) in [RAD Studio](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/rad-studio) as soon as they are released. I therefore work with these versions.

Normally, my libraries and components should also run on at least the current version of [Delphi Community Edition](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi/starter).

There's no guarantee of compatibility with earlier versions, even though I try to keep my code clean and avoid using too many of the new ways of writing in it (type inference, inline var and multiline strings).

If you detect any anomalies on earlier versions, please don't hesitate to [report them](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/PicMobGenerator/issues) so that I can test and try to correct or provide a workaround.
